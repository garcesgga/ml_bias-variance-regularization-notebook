# Bias-Variance Tradeoff Notebook
This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of bias vs variance in machine learning.  
It shows how regression models can suffer from **underfitting** (too simple), **overfitting** (too complex), and how **regularization** (Ridge regression) helps balance bias and variance to improve generalization.

- Understand the bias-variance tradeoff.
- Identify underfitting and overfitting in regression models.
- Apply Ridge regularization to improve generalization.
- Visualize model performance with plots.
